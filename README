This module implements TEA, the Tiny Encryption Algorithm, and some
Modes of Use based on CBC, compatibly in both Perl and JavaScript.
This enables CGI scripts to communicate with browsers.

Subroutines offer encryption, decryption & digest, and all cyphertext
is ascii-encoded to prevent munging. Another routine returns JavaScript
code which offers identical functions in JS, and this will be used by
GCIs to feed to the browser. A wrapper executable 'tea' is included for
command-line use. Triple encryption will be offered later. Tea.pm is
used by the CGI::Htauth.pm authentication and encryption module ...

To install ( cool ! new ! interactive ! ) just:
   perl Install
(but this doesn't yet work yet under Windows)

that's all ! or you can still do it the old way ...
	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make test
	make install

There is a similarly-named module Crypt::TEA.pm by Abhijit Menon-Sen.
The functionality of this Tea.pm is quite different from Abhijit's
TEA.pm; the encryption is done in pure Perl, all cyphertext is ascii-
encoded, and notably there is a subroutine to return JavaScript code
which implements compatible functions in JavaScript.  I wrote Tea.pm
to give me an encryption engine which I could drop into both ends of
an http connection, in Perl at the CGI end and in JavaScript at the
browser end.  Abhijit's TEA.pm is written in C, and uses the further
Crypt::CBC CPAN module; it will run faster, and provides identically
strong encryption, but will not encrypt an http connection.
