This module implements TEA, the Tiny Encryption Algorithm, and some
Modes of Use based on CBC, compatibly in both Perl and JavaScript.
This enables CGI scripts to communicate with browsers.

Subroutines offer encryption, decryption & digest, and all cyphertext
is ascii-encoded to prevent munging. Another routine returns JavaScript
code with identical functions, and this can be used by GCIs to feed to
a browser. A wrapper executable 'tea' is included for command-line use.

To install just:
   perl Install

that's all ! or you can still do it the old way ...
	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make test
	make install

This is version 2.05.

Version 1.45 will probably be the final version in the 1.xx branch.
It is stable, and fully compatible with earlier versions.
Unfortunately, the '+' character used in the ascii-encoding is a reserved
character in the query part of URLs; therefore versions 2.xx switches
to using '-' instead. Versions 2.xx will decrypt files encrypted by 1.xx,
and version 1.45 will decrypt files encrypted by versions 2.xx. However,
the digest (signature) functions of 1.xx and 2.xx will differ in their
use of '+' and '-' characters respectively.

Crypt::Tea can conflict with a similarly-named Crypt::TEA by Abhijit
Menon-Sen.  The functionality of Crypt::Tea is different from Abhijit's
Crypt::TEA; here the encryption is done in pure Perl, all cyphertext is
ascii-encoded, and notably there is a subroutine to return JavaScript
code which implements compatible functions. Unfortunately, Microsoft
operating systems confuse the two names and are unable to install both.
Therefore, after version 2.xx, further development in Crypt::Tea
will take place under the name Crypt::Tea_PPJS.
