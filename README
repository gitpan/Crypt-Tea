NAME
    Crypt::TEA - Tiny Encryption Algorithm

SYNOPSIS
    use Crypt::TEA;

    $cipher = Crypt::TEA->new($key);

    $ciphertext = $cipher->encrypt($plaintext);

    $plaintext = $cipher->decrypt($ciphertext);

DESCRIPTION
    TEA is a 64-bit symmetric block cipher with a 128-bit key
    and a variable number of rounds (32 is recommended). It has a
    low setup time, and depends on a large number of rounds for
    security, rather than a complex algorithm. It was developed
    by David J. Wheeler and Roger M. Needham, and is described at
    <http://www.ftp.cl.cam.ac.uk/ftp/papers/djw-rmn/djw-rmn-tea.html>.

    This module implements TEA encryption. It supports the Crypt::CBC
    interface, with the following functions.

  Functions

    blocksize
        Returns the size (in bytes) of the block (8, in this case).

    keysize
        Returns the size (in bytes) of the key (16, in this case).

    new($key, $rounds)
        This creates a new Crypt::TEA object with the specified
        key. The optional rounds parameter specifies the number of
        rounds of encryption to perform, and defaults to 32.

    encrypt($data)
        Encrypts blocksize() bytes of $data and returns the
        corresponding ciphertext.

    decrypt($data)
        Decrypts blocksize() bytes of $data and returns the
        corresponding plaintext.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
    Dave Paris
        For taking the time to discuss and review the initial
        version of this module, making several useful suggestions,
        and contributing tests.

    Mike Blazer and Gil Cohen
        For testing under Windows.

    Tony Cook
        For making the module work under Activeperl, testing on
        several platforms, and suggesting that I probe for features
        via %Config.
