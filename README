This module implements TEA, the Tiny Encryption Algorithm, and some Modes
of Use based on CBC, compatibly in both Perl and JavaScript. This enables
CGI scripts to communicate with browsers.

Subroutines offer encryption, decryption and digest, and all cyphertext is
ascii-encoded to prevent munging. Another subroutine returns JavaScript
code which offers identical functions in JS, and this will be used by
GCIs to feed to the browser. A wrapper executable 'tea' is included for
command-line use. Triple encryption will be offered later. Tea.pm is
used by the yet-to-be-registered CGI::Htauth.pm authentication module ...

To install Crypt::Tea.pm in the @INC path, and tea in the $PATH path:
	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make install

There is a similarly-named module Crypt::TEA.pm, by Abhijit Menon-Sen.
The functionality of this Tea.pm is quite different from Abhijit's TEA.pm;
the encryption is done in pure Perl, all cyphertext is ascii-encoded, 
and notably there is a subroutine to return JavaScript code which
implements compatible functions in JavaScript.  I wrote Tea.pm to
give me an encryption engine which I could drop into both ends of
an http connection, in Perl at the CGI end and in JavaScript at the
browser end.  Abhijit's TEA.pm is written in C, and also uses the further
Crypt::CBC CPAN module; it will run faster, and provides identically
strong encryption, but is not useful to encrypt an http connection.
