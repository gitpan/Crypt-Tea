This module implements TEA, the Tiny Encryption Algorithm, and some
Modes of Use based on CBC, compatibly in both Perl and JavaScript.
This enables CGI scripts to communicate with browsers.

Subroutines offer encryption, decryption & digest, and all cyphertext
is ascii-encoded to prevent munging. Another routine returns JavaScript
code with identical functions, and this can be used by GCIs to feed to
a browser. A wrapper executable 'tea' is included for command-line use.

To install just:
   perl Install

that's all ! or you can still do it the old way ...
	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make test
	make install
