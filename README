This module implements TEA, the Tiny Encryption Algorithm, and some
Modes of Use based on CBC, compatibly in both Perl and JavaScript.
This enables CGI scripts to communicate with browsers.

Subroutines offer encryption, decryption & digest, and all cyphertext
is ascii-encoded to prevent munging. Another routine returns JavaScript
code with identical functions, and this can be used by GCIs to feed to
a browser. A wrapper executable 'tea' is included for command-line use.

To install just:
   perl Install

that's all ! or you can still do it the old way ...
   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

This is version 2.11.  It is mature, and apart perhaps from minor bug
fixes it will probably be the final version of Crypt::Tea.  Future
developments will take place under the name Crypt::Tea_JS, which will
use some C for extra speed, and the new version of the TEA algorithm.
The calling interface will be identical. Backward compatibility for files
encrypted with this module will be available, but will not be the default.
