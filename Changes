    * More Makefile.PL feature-probing updates.

1.22    2001-05-07

    * Makefile.PL now tries to do the right thing on systems which don't
      have <inttypes.h>.
    * This release should work under Activeperl (thanks to Tony Cook).

1.10    2001-05-04

    * The module (with minor updates) is now distributed under the
      Artistic License.

1.07    2001-04-19

    * This release should build cleanly under Win32. It still crashes
      under Activeperl; Any help with this problem would be appreciated.

1.00    2001-03-30  (By Abhijit Menon-Sen <ams@wiw.org>)

    * First stable release.
